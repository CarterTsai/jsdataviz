Full source code for examples in _Javascript Data Visualization Cookbook_, to be published by [Packt Publishing](http://packtpub.com). This repository is divided into separate folders for each chapter in the book; each of those folders, in turn, contains a separate folder for each recipe. All of the recipe folders are completely self-contained with all required HTML, Javascript, CSS, images, etc. To keep the examples as clean and simple as possible, the code does not use any styles other than those required by the respective libraries. The HTML documents are also stripped of any unnecessary content. For a full explanation of the examples, please refer to the book.
