## Chapter 4: Creating Specialized Graphs

The first three chapters looked at different ways to create many of the common types of charts with Javascript. We saw how to create static bar, line, and scatter plots, how to make them interactive, and how to incorporate them in a complete page. Sometimes, though, a common chart type isn’t the best way to visualize your data. If that data has unique properties, or if you want to show it in an unusual way, a more specialized chart might be the most appropriate format.

Fortunately, there are many Javascript techniques and plugins to expand our visualization vocabulary beyond the standard charts. In this chapter we’ll look at approaches for several specialized chart type. We’ll see how to use

* tree maps to combine hierarchy and dimension
* heat maps to differentiate regions within an area
* Gantt charts to track projects
* network graphs to show linkages between entities
* tree graphs to visualize hierarchies
