## Chapter 5: Showing Time Lines

The most compelling visualizations often succeed because they tell a story; they extract a narrative from data and reveal that narrative to their users. And as with any narrative, _time_ provides a critical component of such visualizations. If our data consists solely of numbers, a standard bar or line chart can easily show its evolution over time. If our data is not numerical, however, standard charts probably won’t work. This chapter considers several alternatives for time-based visualizations. All are based on some variation of a time line; one linear dimension represents time, and events are places along that dimension based on when they occurred. In all of the examples we’ll consider the same underlying data, a [possible chronology of the plays of William Shakespeare](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology_of_Shakespeare%27s_plays).

* a horizontally scrollable time line (http://stoicloofah.github.com/chronoline.js/)
* a rich, multimedia time line (http://timeline.verite.co)
 * built from embedded content
 * using a spreadsheet for its data
 * from JSON objects
